# http-loopback

## Description
This package enables Motoko canisters to call other canister using the Http Outcalls feature of the Internet Computer.

## Major Dependencies
tecdsa - Allows you to generate and manage Threshold ECDSA identities
utilities - Provides convenient classes for nonce generation and fee management

## CAUTION
I'm publishing this package because it *seems* to work fine and I want to share with others.

I've marked this as an alpha release because I have done very little testing outside of making a simple query and update call.

Any and all feedback would be appreciated. I plan to update documentation as soon as I can.

## Example
Please see the "test/" directory for an example:

https://github.com/bittoko/http-loopback/tree/main/test

I have deployed the test canister on mainnet and it *seems* to work fine.
